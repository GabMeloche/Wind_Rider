# Wind_Rider
A Unity game where the player controls a vehicle using a sail as a propellant to navigate through various maps. The player can choose between 3 different vehicles to comandeer, all of which present different properties.

The Aston Martin is a sleek, extra-light model with a not-so-stiff, not-so-loose suspension.
The Mad Max is a very heavy, loose vehicle that's great fun to pilot.
The Wood Car is a very stiff, but fairly stable vehicle.

Controls:

  Mouse: Rotate camera.

  Mouse Wheel: Zoom camera in and out.

  Right-Left Arrows: Rotate the sail.

  A-D: Steer the vehicle's front wheels.

  Escape: Return to main menu.

UI:

  Red bar on right-hand side: Amount of wind caught by the sail.
  
  Bottom-right: Time it is taking to finish this level.
  
  Bottom-left: Speed at which the vehicle is going.
